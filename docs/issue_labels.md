# Issue labels

This document explains every issue label type purpose.

## Custom issue labels

* "bug" - error that cause program to crash or produce invalid results (misbehave);
* "conformance" - something that determines goism Go implementation spec conformance degree;
* "docs" - supplementary documentation; unlike source-level comments, these are intended for non-contributors as well;
* "domain:X" - approximates the issue domain;
* "easy" - issue that does not require high goism knowledge. Good for new contributors;
* "optimization" - task that improves goism generated code efficiency;
* "refactoring" - task that aims to improve code quality and/or reduce technical debt;

## Default issue labels

* "wontfix" - ticket idea is clear, but it will not be solved due to reasons;
* "invalid" - outlined issue is irrelevant;
* "enhancement" - improvement that is visible to the end-users (mostly related to convenience);
* "duplicate" - marks issue as a duplicate. The one who assigns this label should point to other (probably active) issue;
