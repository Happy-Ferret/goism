// Package goism is a collection of high level quality tests.
// They can be classified as integration tests.
//
// Sub-packages are dedicated to specific test types:
// * conformance - checks compiled programs adherence to specs
// * regress - check that previously fixed bugs remain fixed
//
// As a package itself, it provides utilities to
// implement integration tests.
